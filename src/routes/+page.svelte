      I study computers and the like at McGill, where I am still trying to figure out what I enjoy
      most.
    </p>

    <p>
      I hope to make software that people use, not only as a tool, but as a <em class="keyword"
        >creative</em
      >
      and <em class="keyword">exploratory</em> outlet — something that can be used to bring meaning,
      whether that is through learning, collaboration, or simple fun.
    </p>

    <p>
      As such, I try to remain a generalist so that I can understand the innumerable facets of the <em
        class="keyword">systems</em
      > that exist today.

      When I'm not busy, I usually enjoy listening to
